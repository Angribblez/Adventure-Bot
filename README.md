## FAQ
### Why was development stopped?
Development was stopped for a variety of reasons. The key ones being that development and scope were severely limited by discords features, a lack of hope for a discord activities API, and getting bored with the project.

### What would be needed for development to continue?
For the project to continue I would need to either regain interest in the project and/or discord would need to add an easy an powerful way for discord activities to be created.

### Why was discord chosen for the platform?
Discord was chosen because it was not only an easy platform to get running on, but because it had client-server interaction easily managed for multiplayer.
